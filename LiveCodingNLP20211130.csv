WestonH146263737,2020-02-18,"AL, US ",Mine are getting destroyed over just a month just from not toe striking. If you don’t toe strike don’t buy these shoes! I’m having to teach myself a whole different way to run just so I don’t destroy these even more.
M A,2020-11-26,US,"When I ordered these, I hoped I would like them, but I don’t. I LOVE them!! These are by far the best running shoe I have ever owned. From day one, they felt good on my feet. They make me want to run and they seem to automatically make me run faster. I can’t explain it. Pricey? Yes, but boy do they deliver. They do run small, as many have stated. I ordered one size larger and they fit perfectly."

AdamX478300863,2020-04-29,US,"Make more shoes please. These shoes are objectively good racing shoes, and they didn't come out yesterday. I shouldn't have to be waiting months to find these in stock."

Super bummed considering this was not a cheap investment at all. He really was impressed with the shoe, but clearly not a product worth the price. Wouldn’t recommend."
